= Filtering

image::FilterSpec_Diagram.png[]

The main component used to represent a filter expression is the `FilterExpression` class. It consists of an `attribute`, `operator`, and `value` to define the filter condition.

A `FilterGroup` is used to group multiple filter components together and combine them using either the "AND" or "OR" conjunctions.

For example, consider the following simple filter:

[source]
----
GET /person?filter[firstName][EQ]=John&filter[lastName][EQ]=Doe
----

Could be expressed using the following filter components:

[source, java]
----
new FilterGroup().and(
  new FilterExpression("firstName", EQ, "John"), 
  new FilterExpression("lastName", EQ, "Doe")
)
----
