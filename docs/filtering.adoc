= Filtering

image::FilterSpec_Diagram.png[]

The main component used to represent a filter expression is the `FilterExpression` class. It consists of an `attribute`, `operator`, and `value` to define the filter condition.

A `FilterGroup` is used to group multiple filter components together and combine them using either the "AND" or "OR" conjunctions.

For example, consider the following SQL where query:

[source, sql]
----
(firstName == "John" AND lastName == "Doe") OR (firstName == "Jane" AND lastName == "Smith")
----

Could be expressed using the following filter components:

[source]
----
new FilterGroup().or(
  new FilterGroup().and(
    new FilterExpression("firstName", EQ, "John"), 
    new FilterExpression("lastName", EQ, "Doe")
  ), 
  new FilterGroup().and(
    new FilterExpression("firstName", EQ, "Jane"), 
    new FilterExpression("lastName", EQ, "Smith")
  )
)
