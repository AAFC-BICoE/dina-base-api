= Validation

== The Principles
From dina-base 0.51 onward, we disable the automatic validation and move it to the Service layer where Spring integration is better. 

Before dina-base was mostly relying on JPA level validation which worked for most application but can be difficult when we need customization (internationalization and localization) or custom validations.

== Implementation

Validation is done at the Service level and is automatically handled by `DefaultDinaService`.

There is 2 types of validation at the Service level :

* Constraints validation (automatic checks that will use the constraint annotations on the Entity)
* Business rule(s) validation (must be implemented by the concrete Service by overriding the `validateBusinessRules` method)

Constraint validation also supports validation group `OnCreate` and `OnUpdate`.
