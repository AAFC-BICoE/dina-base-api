= Releasing dina-base-api

The process of releasing dina-base-api is partially automated.

To initiate the process:

. From dev branch
.. Run the GitHub Action `Prepare dina-base-api release`
.. Wait for CI to complete
. From master locally
.. Pull the master branch
.. Merge dev into master (do NOT use Pull Request)
.. Push to master (it will trigger the deployment to the staging repository of Maven Central)
. Create a new https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-base-api/releases[GitHub release]
.. Add a Summary of the changes (looks at the previous versions for an example)
.. Publish the Release
. From dev branch
.. Change the version by running `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.X-SNAPSHOT` from the root where X.X is the next increment in the version number
.. Add and Push to dev with message like "Prepare next development version"
. Release the artifact to Maven Central
.. Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
.. Close the release from staging repository
.. Release the artifact
