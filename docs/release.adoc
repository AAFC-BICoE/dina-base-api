= Releasing dina-base-api

The process of releasing dina-base-api is partially automated.

To initiate the process:

. From dev branch
.. Change the version by running `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.X` from the root where `X.X` is the current version minus the `-SNAPSHOT`
.. Update the `README.md` Artifact section
.. Add and Push to dev with message like "Prepare version x.x release"
. From master
.. Merge dev into master (do NOT use Pull Request)
.. Push to master (it will trigger the deployment of the artifacts to https://bintray.com/aafc-bice/BICoE/dina-base-api[BinTray] )
. Create a new https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-base-api/releases[GitHub release]
.. Add a Summary of the changes (looks at the previous versions for an example)
.. Publish the Release
. From dev branch
.. Change the version by running `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.X-SNAPSHOT` from the root where X.X is the next increment in the version number
.. Add and Push to dev with message like "Prepare next development version"
