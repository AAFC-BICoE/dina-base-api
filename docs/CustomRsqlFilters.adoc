= Custom Rsql Filtering

== Current Specs

You can add custom rsql filtering for your resource in order to manipulate how Rsql filters will be processed.

=== Step 1: Create a RsqlFilterAdapter for your class.

This is a simple Functional interface which will provide the entry point to run your business logic to process the Rsql filters.

 Node process(Node node);

=== Step 2: Pass your filter adapter to the Dina filter resolver.

The DinaFilterResolver will allow you to pass your adapter to the resolver.

 void addRsqlAdapter(Class<?> clz, RsqlFilterAdapter adapter)

You can do this during the creation of your repository for the resource, or else where if needed.

'''

NOTE: The DinaFilterResolver will only run your adapter when a Rsql filter for your resource is detected in the request.
