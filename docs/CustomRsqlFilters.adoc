= Custom Rsql Filtering

== Current Specs

You can add custom rsql filtering for your resource in order to manipulate how Rsql filters will be processed.

=== Step 1: Create a RsqlFilterAdapter for your class.

This is a simple Functional interface which will provide the entry point to run your business logic to process the Rsql filters.

 Node process(Node node);

The process method will receive the root node of the rsql filters and will return the final rsql node to be used in the filtering process.

=== Step 2: Pass your filter adapter to the Dina filter resolver.

The DinaFilterResolver will allow you to pass your adapter to the resolver in the constructor.

You can do this during the creation of your repository for the resource.

 DinaFilterResolver(@NonNull DinaService<T> service, RsqlFilterAdapter rsqlFilterAdapter)
